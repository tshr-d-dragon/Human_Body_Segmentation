# Human_Body_Segmentation
A Deep Learning project focuses on Semantic Segmentation of Human Body 

This projects helps predicting segmentation masks of Human Body and hence changing background. I tried 2 transfer learning models for training: Unet with MobileNetV2 as a backbone and DeepLabV3p with MobileNetV2 as a backbone. Performance for both of the models trained for 45 epochs is given below:
